        <h3 class="lead left"><strong>What is FuelSignal?</strong></h3>

        <p class="lead left">The FuelSignal app makes it easy for its users to save money on fuel by shopping at 

participating retailers and gas stations. The FuelSignal Loyalty Program mobile app 

solution help businesses and communities connect in real-time and convert every customer 

transaction into a relationship. FuelSignal offers a unique proposition in the industry that is 

attractive to consumers and to businesses. FuelSignal is the industry's first "Connected Car" 

based Fuel Reimbursement Loyalty Program platform for small and large fuel and non-fuel 

retailers.</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How does FuelSignal work?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Customers see all the FuelSignal retailers’ coupons, promotions, and deals from nearby

restaurants, beauty salons, ice cream shops, grocery stores, and so much more. Next, 

customers select the promotion from retailers by simply tapping the promotion. You 

may see an offer such as:
</p>

<ul class="left">
  <li>i.e. Pizza shop promotion: Take $4 off a $10 regular priced lunch, plus get an
additional .50 cents in Fuel Credit)</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead left">When you visit the Pizza shop, you will simply present your saved coupon offer at

checkout, saving you $4.00 on lunch. Once the transaction is completed, you will see 

the additional 50 cents of Fuel Credit in your account that you may now spend at any 

FuelSignal gas station.</p>

<p class="lead left">
All FuelSignal gas stations are also offering great in-store promotions and additional 

discounts on all fuel purchases. Thus, one single FuelSignal GPS based mobile loyalty 

app can save you money across many retailers.</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do I become a FuelSignal member?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Takes less than 60 seconds, all you have to do is download the free FuelSignal app 

and sign-up. In some cases you may also be able to sign-up at a business directly with 

an employee.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Where do I download FuelSignal App?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
You can download FuelSignal for free through the Apple App Store and the Google 

Play Store.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How can FuelSignal help me save money?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal will help you save money on all your everyday purchases at and away from 

the gas station. By using FuelSignal you can feel confident in knowing that you not 

only save money every time your car needs fuel but also at all the participating non-

fuel retailers in your city. By using great promotions at partner retailers you also get 

free Fuel Credit, helping you save on those cumbersome gas prices.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How much is FuelSignal?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal membership is completely, absolutely, without a doubt free for all 

customers. The more you use FuelSignal, the more money you will save and earn.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Where can I use FuelSignal?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Tap the “Near Me” button on the home screen and you will see a list of everything 

nearby such as restaurants, salons, gas stations and so much more. You can sort the 

results by price or promotional discount being offered. FuelSignal encompasses a large 

network of retailers such as salons, restaurants, coffee shops, our extensive gas station 

network, and so much more.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do I earn and redeem Fuel Credit?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
With FuelSignal you earn free gas money for using coupons and promotions at all of 

our partner stores. Use the FuelSignal app to have your “tap n’ save” QR code scanned 

before you make any purchase to make sure you earn rewards. If you are redeeming 

promotions you will either need to have the QR code within the specific promotion 

scanned or if you’re using more than 1, mark all the deals you want to use and they 

will be saved into your “tap n’ save” QR code to be redeemed in 1 scan.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do I know the gas prices are correct?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Our prices will always be accurate and we do this by getting prices directly from our 

partner stores. Because we work directly with our stores all promotions, discounts, and 

gas prices will always be accurate.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How can I find the closest gas station to me?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Tap the “Gas Stations Near Me” button from the home screen to see a list of the 

results. FuelSignal uses your GPS location to give you the most accurate search results.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Why should I turn on my GPS?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Turning on your GPS will help you in several ways.
</p>

<ol class="left">
  <li>When you click “gas stations near me” you will be given accurate store and travel
distances.</li>
  <li>You will be able to track your exact mileage</li>
  <li>Your Fuel Log purchase history will be accurate</li>
  <li>Your “Low fuel alert” will help you when you most need it</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>What is the “low fuel alert” notification and how does it work?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
The “low fuel alert “ is a notification you receive when you are running low on fuel.

From the “Settings” section of the app you will click “Update Vehicle” and go to the 

last field titled “Alert at Minimum Fuel Level”. This is where you choose how many 

miles away from empty you would like to receive the “low fuel alert”.

<ul class="left">
  
  <li>i.e. You set your alert to 20 miles before empty. When you car is 20 miles away

from running out of gas, you will receive the “low fuel alert”</li>
  
</ul>
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Can I use both a credit card loyalty program and FuelSignal?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Yes, even when you are using a credit card based loyalty program, you will be able to

use FuelSignal to save even more on all your gas station purchases. (Many of the gas 

brands have credit cards, helping you save money so using FuelSignal in addition to these 

cards will help you save even more)
</p>


<h1 class="left">Rewards</h1>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do I use promotions inside the store?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Using 1 promotion:
</p>

<ul class="left">
  <li>Simply pickup your items inside the store</li>
  <li>Scan the QR code found within the promotion itself</li>
  <li>Congrats, you have just redeemed the promotion and will be rewarded shortly!</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead left">
Using 2 or more promotions:</p>

  <li>Mark and choose all the promotions you would like to redeem for the current

store visit</li>
  <li>Pickup all your items inside the store</li>
  <li>Scan your “tap n’ save” QR code with the cashier before you make your

purchase</li>
<li>You have now just redeemed all your promotions with 1 scan</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do I earn rewards for my gas purchases?</strong></h3>

  <li>The cashier will validate your receipt</li>

</ol>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How can I redeem my rewards at gas stations?</strong></h3>

Scan your “tap n’ save” FuelSignal QR code before you buy anything and if you have 
any credit balance the cashier will ask you if you would like to redeem your earned 
credits.
</p>
<p class="lead left"><italic>
*Some retailers may not be using a merchant app to scan your QR code. For theses 

merchants you will   need to enter your FuelSignal ID into the PIN pad inside the store or 

outside at the pump. (FuelSignal ID is 11+phone number including area code)</italic>
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How does SIGNAL CREDIT work?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
You can earn SIGNAL CREDIT by going to and redeeming deals at any business that is 

not a gas station. FuelSignal is rewarding you with free Gas Money for going to 

businesses and redeeming promotions. The further you are from a business (up to 5 

miles) the more Gas Money you will earn.
</p>



<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Where can I find my credits?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
You can find your credits in the My Rewards tab within the FuelSignal app.
</p>


<h3 class="lead left"><strong>When can I use my discounts?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Store specific rewards can be redeemed on your next in-store or fuel purchase. All you 

have to do is scan your “tap n’ save” FuelSignal QR code before your purchase to see if 

you have credits that are ready to redeem.
</p>



<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Where can I use money and SIGNAL CREDITS?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Fuel Credit you earn from fueling up at FuelSignal gas stations can only be used at 

that specific store brand (i.e. Star Stop in Austin). SIGNAL CREDITS you earn from 

redeeming promotions can be used at any FuelSignal gas station location.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Can I use SIGNAL CREDITS on in-store purchases?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
SIGNAL CREDIT can be used for anything at any FuelSignal gas station.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Do any of my rewards or credits expire?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Your rewards and credits do expire but you will have more than enough time to make 

sure you get to take advantage of your earnings. Other deals on the other hand have a 

limited feature time, so take advantage of them quickly.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do I keep track of my savings and Rewards Points?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
You can keep track of your Reward Points by logging in to the FuelSignal App. Simply 

select the store tab where you earned the points and you will see My Loyalty Rewards. 

Here you will see the reward credits that you have earned with that particular retailer 

brand.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do I save money at the pump?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal rewards you for your loyalty at our partner gas stations. When you pump 

fuel make sure to scan your “tap n’ save” QR code and have your receipt validated by 

the cashier, doing this will ensure that you are rewarded for all your gasoline 

purchases.
</p>

<ol class="left">
  <li>Inside the store you will have your “tap n’ save” FuelSignal QR code scanned by

the cashier</li>
  <li>The cashier will validate your receipt</li>
  <li>You get credit for each gallon of fuel you purchase</li>
</ol>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>I went to a FuelSignal gas station and the pump didn’t ask for my FuelSignal ID, how can I 
get my credit?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Make sure to go inside the store to scan your “tap n’ save” QR code and have your

receipt validated by the cashier, doing this will ensure that you are rewarded for all 

your gasoline purchases.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Can I share deals with my friends?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Yes, let everyone know about the app and you will also be rewarded. We have social 

buttons so you can share deals easily with your friends.
</p>



  <h3 class="lead left"><strong>I don’t have a smart phone/ I don’t have my smart phone on me, how can I take advantage 
of deals?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
We will soon launch an online sign-in option on FuelSignal.com. This way you can still 

earn FUEL CREDIT and take advantage of great deals!
</p>


  <h3 class="lead left"><strong>Do I need a loyalty reward card at the gas pump?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
We think you have too many cards so we don’t make you carry one either. FuelSignal
does not currently use loyalty reward cards.
</p>
