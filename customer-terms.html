“Fuel Credit” is a form of Site credit that is redeemable only towards future FuelSignal store fuel station 

purchases. There are several ways Users can earn Fuel Credits. By redeeming promotions at various 

FuelSignal retailers, customers will be rewarded with Fuel Credit. Fuel Credit can be viewed as gas 

money that is given to Users, helping them pay for fuel related expenses incurred by traveling to and 

from retailers.   

When FuelSignal advertises Merchant campaigns, discounts, promotions, including discounts, loyalty 

points, rewards and/or any other incentives (collectively, “<strong>Merchant Promotions</strong>”) associated with your

Customers/Users' purchases of goods and/or services as promised to Customers/Users.

All Campaigns run on the FuelSignal platform, including the manner in which Customer/User Credit is 

awarded, redeemed, and applied, must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and 

regulations. Redemption or application of Campaign Credit, discounts, for gasoline and alcoholic 

beverages is at the sole discretion of the Merchant, and is subject to compliance with applicable federal,

<p class="lead left">
These Terms and Conditions are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sub-licensable

by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and 

obligations hereunder without consent.
</p>
<h3 class="left">27. General</h3>

<p class="lead left">
This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties as to its subject matter, and supersedes 

all prior written and oral representations and discussions between the parties. If a matter arises that 

cannot be resolved between you and FuelSignal with reasonable effort, you agree that all such 

disagreements or disputes that in any way involves the Terms and Conditions shall be resolved 

exclusively by final and binding administration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and will 

be conducted before a single arbiter pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the 

AAA. You agree that the arbitration shall be held in Texas, or at any other location that is mutually 

agreed upon by you and FuelSignal. You agree that the arbiter will apply the laws of Texas consistent 

with the Federal Arbitration Act, and will honor and agree to all applicable statutes of limitation. You 

agree that, unless prohibited by law, there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class 

or representative basis, and arbitration will only decide a dispute between you and FuelSignal. If any 

part of this Arbitration clause is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then the remaining portions of 

this section shall remain in effect, with the exception of the class language referenced herein, in such 

case this entire section shall be deemed invalid.
</p>
<p class="lead left">
  The parties are independent contractors. Except for our right to advertise on your behalf in accordance 

with the Terms and Conditions, this Agreement does not create any joint venture or agency, and you and 

we are independent contractors without the power to bind the other.
</p>
<p class="lead left">
  
  All communications between Users and FuelSignal, and any notices due hereunder, may use electronic 

means. For contractual purposes, User (a) consents to receive communications from FuelSignal in an 

electronic form, and (b) agrees that all Terms and Conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other 

communications that FuelSignal provides to you electronically will satisfy any legal requirement that 

such communications would satisfy if they were in writing. The foregoing does not affect the Users 

statutory rights. <br/>

If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement invalid, such invalidity shall 

not affect the enforceability of any other provisions contained in this Agreement, and the remaining 

portions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
</p>
<h3 class="left">28. Choice of Law and Location for Resolving Legal Disputes</h3>

<p class="lead left">
Any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Texas, without 

regard to its choice of law rules and without regard to conflicts of laws principles except that the 

Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the Arbitration provision. These Terms and Conditions are void 

where prohibited.<br/>

You and FuelSignal agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Travis 

County, Texas for the purpose of litigating claims.
</p>

<h3 class="left">29. Arbitration Option</h3>

<p class="lead left">
For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the 

award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost 

effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects 

arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution 

(“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply 

with the following rules:
</p>

<ul class="left">
  <li>Arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written

submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;</li>
  <li>Arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless

otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and</li>
  <li>Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any

court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="left">30. Force Majeure</h3>

<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure

results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, 

electronic or communications failure or degradation.
</p>

<h3 class="left">31. Additional Disclosures</h3>

<p class="lead left">
No waiver by either you or FuelSignal of any breach or default or failure to exercise any right allowed 

under these Terms and Conditions is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default or a 

waiver or forfeiture of any similar or future rights under our Terms and Conditions The section headings 

used herein are for convenience only and shall be of no legal force or effect. If a court of competent 

jurisdiction holds any provision of our Agreement invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the 

enforceability of any other provisions contained in these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining 

portions of our Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
</p>

<p class="lead left">
  The provisions of these Terms of Use apply equally to and are for the benefit of FuelSignal, its 

subsidiaries, affiliates, Merchants and its third-party content providers and licensors, and each shall have 

the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly.
</p>
