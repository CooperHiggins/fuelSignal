<h1 class="left">Costs</h1>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How much does it cost to use FuelSignal?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
There is no upfront cost using FuelSignal to drive customers to your business. You will only
be charged for customers that have been to your business and redeemed a promotion. 
FuelSignal ensures that you are only paying for advertising after we have already driven 
traffic to your business.

<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal will allow you to spend less while being more efficient with your marketing

unlike most traditional advertising, at around a 2% conversion rate. All of your advertising
dollars are spent on successful customer conversions opening the ability to issue better 
promotions to your customers, which creates a great customer experience that drives them 
back over and over again.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>What are SIGNAL CREDITS?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
SIGNAL CREDITS are Fuel Credits, which are earned by customers for driving from their 

current location to non-fuel merchants and redeeming promotions. This credit can only be 

used at FuelSignal partner gas stations.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How do customers earn SIGNAL CREDITS?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
The amount of SIGNAL CREDIT a customer earns when they redeem a promotion is based 

on how many miles the customer traveled to get to your business. The moment a customer 

saves a promotion FuelSignal pings the customers location and calculates the customers’ 

distance to the retailer.  After a customer redeems the promotion, FuelSignal will reward 

the customer with some SIGNAL CREDIT based on the calculated distance. This is 

FuelSignal’s way of rewarding the customer community, while keeping them engaged.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>Who pays for the free gas money customers receive?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal issues Free Gas Money as a contribution to the customer community.  A portion 

of FuelSignal’s transaction revenue is given back to the customers to encourage higher 

customer retention and engagement with your business.
</p>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How much does it cost to run a campaign?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal works directly with you and your business to create successful promotions that 

will encourage customer engagement. FuelSignal charges a flat fee for every promotion 

that is redeemed at your business. The FuelSignal fee is approximately 15% of the amount 

paid by the customer and is calculated on a case-by-case scenario.<br/>
(i.e. Pizza shop promotion: Buy 1 lunch for $10 and get 1 lunch free (a $20 value))
</p>

<ul class="left">
  <li>$10 = amount paid by the customer to your business</li>
  <li>15% of the paid amount by customer to your business is $1.50</li>
  <li>$1.50 = will be the only fee paid to FuelSignal for every customer redemption</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How will I be billed?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
Merchants are able to maintain full control of their budgets in real-time. Merchants load an 

advertising account, which will be debited as customers redeem promotions. The billing 

process can be compared in a similar fashion to the way your current search engine 

advertising platforms charge you on a per-click basis.
(i.e. Pizza shop promotion: Buy 1 lunch for $10 and get 1 lunch free (a $20 value))
</p>
<ul class="left">
  <li>(35 customers) x ($1.50 ea./customer) = $52.50 deducted from the Pizza shops

merchant account</li>
  
</ul>

<h3 class="lead left"><strong>How much is the set up fee?</strong></h3>
<p class="lead left">
FuelSignal does not charge any setup fee to join and use our platform. We only charge your 

business based on the number of customers that go to your businesses and redeem 

promotional offerings. ~ First 25 customers are complimentary for a limited time!
