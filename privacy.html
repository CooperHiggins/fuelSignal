</p>
<h3 class="lead left">Uses of Information  </h3>
<p class="lead left">

FuelSignal's site's registration form requires users to give FuelSignal contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, or age). FuelSignal uses customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about FuelSignal and promotional material from some of FuelSignal's partners. FuelSignal will send out any emails to the users, if necessary, for the promotional materials. FuelSignal does not share this information with our partners or distributors. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary and allow users to interact on the site with others through messages or comments as well as make purchases. FuelSignal may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor the visitor's experience on FuelSignal's site and/or any other mobile applications that you may use to show the visitor content that FuelSignal thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. The demographic and profile data will be shared with third parties ONLY on an aggregate basis.  
Furthermore, FuelSignal shall have the right to retain records of all data pertaining to use of the website, mobile applications, or any other software including, but not limited to, usage, activity logs, and click-trough’s. FuelSignal may disclose such data to third parties provided it is grouped with other FuelSignal user’s data and is presented in an aggregate form. You can use the service without registering, however, you may not be able to use certain features of the service such as gas discounts, sweepstakes, drawings, giveaways, etc. FuelSignal may automatically collect information about you when you use the service regardless of its website or through mobile device, we will automatically collect information such as device ID, device type, geo-location information, mileage tracking etc. If you use the service through a mobile device and don't want us to track or collect your geo-location then you may change your preferences through "Settings" of the FuelSignal mobile application. However, if you select your preference for us to not collect your mileage tracking or geo-location information, then you may limit some of the feature of the service such as automatic reminder when fuel is below the threshold or find the "Nearest Gas Station with Discount". 
</p>
<h3 class="lead left">Security of Personal Information</h3>
<p class="lead left">

We will not share, sell, rent or trade your personal information with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy.
Except as described in this section, we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without notifying you of our intent to share the information and giving you an opportunity to prevent your information from being shared. From time to time, we may partner with companies based on the interests and feedback of our users in additional items for purchase. These partner companies will never see your email address or any other information that could identify you or be used to contact you directly.
FuelSignal reserves the right to disclose information when required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.
